## About the Project

VR Fire Safety Training is a virtual reality simulation designed to educate apartment tenants about emergency fire response. Built for the Meta Quest Pro headset, this immersive experience teaches fire extinguisher usage, hazard recognition, and evacuation procedures in a multi-floor residential environment.

By allowing users to safely interact with fire hazards and emergency equipment, the simulation helps build confidence and preparedness without real-world risk.

## Description of Training Modules

Our VR experience consists of 3 key modules as follows:

1. **Fire Extinguisher Training**: Learn to identify and operate with extinguishers against fires in the apartment.

2. **Hazard Sandbox**: Freely explore the environment, identify common fire risks, and experiment with object interactions.

3. **Evacuation Simulation**: Respond to an active fire alarm and execute proper evacuation procedures across multiple apartment levels.
